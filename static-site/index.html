                <p>
                    Like most thirteen year old boys, I had an abundance of time and energy, and I found a hobby that allowed me to utilize those resources. Unlike most thirteen year old boys, my hobby was teaching myself <span class="emphasis">C</span>.
                    With no internet access and no IDE, I checked out a book from the library, <i>C for Dummies</i>, which came with a CD copy of the GNU command-line compiler. Over the summer, whenever I wasn't with friends or doing something else, I
                    was writing code into MS Notepad, relying on compiler feedback to debug, and learning the basics of memory allocation, pointers, flow control, subroutines, and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After learning C, I taught myself HTML and CSS, and Blender 3D. Then, when I was 16, I managed to get a tech internship at State Farm, the insurance company. I thought I was pretty computer-savvy, and would have a pretty easy time at State Farm. However,
                    somebody in Human Resources decided that C, my main skill, was about the same as C++, and C++ was about the same as Java. BAM! I got a big reality check when I started working with Java and realized I knew nothing about
                    <span class="emphasis">Object Oriented Programming</span> concepts!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The State Farm internship was also my first exposure to Agile, specifically <span class="emphasis">Scrum style Agile</span>. I returned to state farm in 2016, then after the summer ended I headed off to college!

                <p>
                    When I first started college, I wasn't sure exactly what I wanted to do. Obviously I had the programming experience from two summers of work, plus countless hours of doing it as a hobby. However, I was also very interested in Physics, and I decided to
                    pursue that. After my freshman year, however, I realized that I enjoyed learning physics, but I couldn't see myself going to grad school for it, or getting a job as an engineer.
