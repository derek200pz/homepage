        <h1 class="text-center">As a Kid</h1>
        <p>
          Like most thirteen year old boys, I had an abundance of time and
          energy, and I found a hobby that allowed me to utilize those
          resources. Unlike most thirteen year old boys, my hobby was teaching
          myself <span class="emphasis">C</span>. With no internet access and no
          IDE, I checked out a book from the library, <i>C for Dummies</i>,
          which came with a CD copy of the GNU command-line compiler. Over the
          summer, whenever I wasn't with friends or doing something else, I was
          writing code into MS Notepad, relying on compiler feedback to debug,
          and learning the basics of memory allocation, pointers, flow control,
          subroutines, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          After learning C, I taught myself HTML and CSS, and Blender 3D. Then,
          when I was 16, I managed to get a tech internship at State Farm, the
          insurance company. I thought I was pretty computer-savvy, and would
          have a pretty easy time at State Farm. However, somebody in Human
          Resources decided that C, my main skill, was about the same as C++,
          and C++ was about the same as Java. BAM! I got a big reality check
          when I started working with Java and realized I knew nothing about
          <span class="emphasis">Object Oriented Programming</span> concepts!
        </p>
        <p>
          The State Farm internship was also my first exposure to Agile,
          specifically <span class="emphasis">Scrum style Agile</span>. I
          returned to state farm in 2016, then after the summer ended I headed
          off to college!

        <h1 class="text-center">College Years</h1>
        <p>
          When I first started college, I wasn't sure exactly what I wanted to
          do. Obviously I had the programming experience from two summers of
          work, plus countless hours of doing it as a hobby. However, I was also
          very interested in Physics, and I decided to pursue that. After my
          freshman year, however, I realized that I enjoyed learning physics,
          but I couldn't see myself going to grad school for it, or getting a
          job as an engineer.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the beginning of my sophomore year, I switched majors from physics
          to computer science. Because there was so much overlap between the
          programs (math, lab science classes, etc) I managed to graduate in
          four years with not too much extra effort, and I got two minors:
          physics and math.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also my sophomore year, I became a Resident Assistant for university
          housing, a position I have continued in for four years now! There are
          many different dorm buildings and even an apartment complex on campus,
          and I have returned to a different location every year I've worked as
          an RA. My personal favorite is the apartment complex, Cougar Village.
          Although its a little further from campus, CV has a much more
          independent feel, and is very pretty in the autumn.

        <p>
          Being a resident assistant and a full time student kept my busy during
          the schoolyear, but over the summers, I managed to get lucky and snag
          a couple internships with State Farm Mutual Insurance Company in
          Bloomington, IL (Right next to my home town!). I thought it would be
          the same as the internships I worked in high school, but once again,
          state farm gave me a challenge. Their college program was harder, and
          also included a mandatory speech program. However, this time I was
          much better prepared for the challenge, and gained a lot of new
          skills, including AWS, Kubernetes, Spring Tool Suite, React and
          Angular JS, and Scrum Agile!

        <h1 class="text-center">Graduate School</h1>
        <p>
          After graduating (Summa Cum Laude) with my bachelors in computer
          science, I decided to go back to SIUE for graduate school. SIUE offers
          an accelerated program where I took grad-level classes during my
          undergrad senior year, and those got counted toward both my bachelors
          and my masters, allowing me to cut a semester off my masters program.
          That's where I am now, and while it's certainly not easy, I am
          enjoying the challenging but rewarding work I am doing.
